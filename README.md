**Granular and Relational SWOT Analysis: An Ontological Approach**  
Presented at the *6th International Conference on Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing*.

## **Overview**

Traditional Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) analysis, despite its widespread use, faces a critical limitation in effectively interpreting information through the *SWOT Matrix (SM)*. The conventional matrix lacks the granularity and relational depth necessary for comprehensive decision-making.

To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces **SWOTONT**, an ontology designed to semantically model SWOT analysis. SWOTONT is developed using a bottom-up ontology development approach, incorporating insights from a literature review and domain experts. The ontology enhances SWOT analysis by introducing finer subcategories, defining interrelationships among factors, and structuring the information for improved knowledge extraction.

By leveraging **OWL2**, SWOTONT provides a structured, semantic foundation for strategic decision-making. Future research will focus on empirical validation through case studies, integrating an upper ontology, and exploring further applications of the model.

## **Key Features**
- **Ontology-driven SWOT Analysis:** Developed using the **Bottom-Up Ontology Development Approach** and **OWL2**.
- **Granular SWOT Categorization:** Enhanced classification of SWOT factors with subcategories and detailed attributes.
- **Relational Context:** Captures influence patterns between SWOT elements for better strategic analysis.

## **Repository Contents**
- `ontology/` ‚Äì Contains the **OWL** files for SWOTONT.
