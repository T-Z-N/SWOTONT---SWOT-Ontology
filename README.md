# Semantic Modeling of SWOT Analysis

This repository contains the ontology and related resources for the paper "Granular and Relational SWOT Analysis: An Ontological Approach," presented at the 6th International Conference on Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing.

## Overview

The traditional Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) analysis, despite its popularity, faces a significant challenge
in interpreting information through the ”SWOT Matrix (SM)”. The conventional matrix inherently fails to capture the
complexity and detailed characteristics necessary for comprehensive decision-making. Therefore, this paper introduces an innovative
approach to address these limitations by an ontology SWOTONT representing the domain of SWOT analysis. SWOTONT
is developed through a literature review and a bottom-up ontology development approach, providing context to the SWOT attributes
by introducing finer subcategories and mapping their interrelationships. By developing a structured semantic approach,
authors aimed to enable more precise knowledge extraction and support advanced strategic analysis. Future work will focus on
empirical validation through case studies and domain expert feedback, integrating an upper ontology and exploring additional
applications of the model.

- An ontology developed using the Bottom-Up Ontology Development Approach and OWL2.
